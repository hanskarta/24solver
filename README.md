# 24solver

24solver is a solver to a game named 24. Basically the game uses a bridge card where value of 2-10 is 2-10, JQK is 10 and A is either 1 or 11 (you may choose).

in general here are the rules of 24 card game :
1. shuffle a deck of card
2. deal the top 4 cards from the deck
3. use +-*: to make 24 out of those 4 cards

this project was not to make a 24 solver since alot of people has made a normal 24 solver in the past. however the project aims to make a solver that can solve not only 4 cards but more than 4 for example : 5. 3. 3. 2. 1 then we hope that the solver finds (5*3)+(3*(2+1)).

any advice or features that any of you think is a good addition to this solver can be requested however we (both of the creators) are not in any computer science program yet so we might have some limitation, but still shoot your shot.

to run the solver go ahead and download the solver from rhe main branch and run it in cmd promt
